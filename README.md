HACIT - Humanitarian Aid Cost Integration Tool is a tool made by Daniel &amp; Rashmi, students from UC Berkeley, to help MercyCorps foundation to create a calculator. This tool will calculate transportation, baskets, and human resource to the total spending. We use APIs to get the current distance, price, and exchange rates to visualize.
