# MercyCorps_Hackathon
HACIT - Humanitarian Aid Cost Integration Tool is a tool made by Daniel &amp; Rashmi, students from UC Berkeley, to help MercyCorps foundation to create a calculator. This tool will calculate transportation, baskets, and human resource to the total spending. We use APIs to get the current distance, price, and exchange rates to visualize.

The database of food that we use is based on internet scraping which we put in a google spreadsheet and connected through API. Please check this link to the database:
